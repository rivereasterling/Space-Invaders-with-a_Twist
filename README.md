# Space-Invaders-with-a_Twist
Contains the link to both the main,testcase and asset file which is the img file.
Remeber inorder to get this too work you need to put the assets file into the python project file 
to do this for pycharm do
User/River(whateveryouruseriscalled)/PycharmProjects/pythonprojects then move the folder into pythonprojects

I do not know if this works or is different for other launchers besides Pycharm and I don't know if this process will work for other operating systems like linex
